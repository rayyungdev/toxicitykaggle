One thing to keep in mind is that we will want our algorithm to generalize, therefore having a keyword classifer might not be particularly useful. Instead of looking for specific words, we should think about the underlying trends in the data.      \n",

As explained in the project description, it is very difficult to rank a list of comments entirely. Instead, it is a lot easier to judge two comments and rank which one is toxic. I should keep this in mind when I'm building my future algorithm. Instead of loading the entire dataset into my model, it might be better to use a sliding window method that takes in two comments and spits out which one is considered more toxic. This leads me to think that a binary classifier might be particularly useful. However, how would we identify the unlabeled features? Hmmm.... How much natural language processing is actually necessary here?\n",
