One thing to keep in mind is that we will want our algorithm to generalize, therefore having a keyword classifer might not be particularly useful. Instead of looking for specific words, we should think about the underlying trends in the data.      \n",

As explained in the project description, it is very difficult to rank a list of comments entirely. Instead, it is a lot easier to judge two comments and rank which one is toxic. I should keep this in mind when I'm building my future algorithm. Instead of loading the entire dataset into my model, it might be better to use a sliding window method that takes in two comments and spits out which one is considered more toxic. This leads me to think that a binary classifier might be particularly useful. However, how would we identify the unlabeled features? Hmmm.... How much natural language processing is actually necessary here?\n",

    "So, as you can see from my histogram, my blanket idea is flawed. My method at the moment doesn't take into account the different lengths of each comment, which may skew it. That being said, my method does show that more toxic comments do generally contain a capitalized word to string length ratio of one. This coincides with what I claimed earlier that this method might only show specific outliers. Looking at the the invidual plots, we see that comments with a ratio of 1 (meaning that all the words in the sentence are capitalized) is almost 3x  more likely to be regarded as toxic. This might be a good way to do initial screenings, but we cannot discern other scenarios. \n",

Given our objective, which was to rank comments based off of toxicity, we are dealing with sentient analysis which is \"the process of detecting positive or negative sentiment in text.\" This is an area that has been thoroughly researched, so I really should have been looking at previous ideas in this subject.   \n",
